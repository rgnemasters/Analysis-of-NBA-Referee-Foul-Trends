# Analysis-of-NBA-Referee-Foul-Trends

Data of referee foul calls was downloaded from https://data.world/akas3006/nba-dat-vis/workspace in order to analyze if rates of fouls called changed for the NBA playoffs vs. the regular season. Analysis focused on shooting fouls, since these are fouls which most determine the points total of games, and so could be useful in future models. Analysis was also limited to those with 20 or more games in each category, to ensure a large enough sample size.

The data seem to indicate 1) that shooting fouls called actually decreases on average in the playoffs vs. the regular season, and that 2) there is a significant difference caused by the referees that were first and second in this category. For predictive purposes, it may be important to keep in mind outlier referees in such categories.
